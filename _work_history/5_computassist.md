### Description
My role at the company allowed me to really flex my programming muscles. Prior to this job, at the previous company, 
I had done only HTML/CSS with a bit of JavaScript. The first major project I got plunged into was a point of sale 
invoice display application. This application needed to display an invoice to the shopper at the checkout area 
and also simultaneously show image and video advertisements. I also worked on an effort to migrate the
main software product offered by the company, from COBOL to C#. I was the sole developer in these projects. 
Looking back now I can appreciate the learning experience these gave me. 

My time at Computassist afforded me the opportunity to grow my research and problem solving skills which 
served me well as an engineer in later years.
