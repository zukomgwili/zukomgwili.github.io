### Description

I was an individual contributor in a team responsible for developing and supporting a payment portal that enables customers to settle their invoices using several payment options. I contributed to a number of microservices that support the payment portal.
The two services that are worth highlighting are:

- A customer queries service which manages queries raised by customers and routes them to the relevant parties.
- A service that allows the customer to make alternate payment arrangements if he/she is unable to make payment.

I participated in discussions with the design and the product teams about product goals and how best to accomplish them.
