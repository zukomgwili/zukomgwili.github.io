### Description

My tenure at the company gave me my initial exposure to ideas around SOA (Service Oriented Architecture). SOA was 
the buzzword of the day during those years and numerous software vendors offered tools for building SOA software systems. 
We used a suite of tools from IBM to build a system that would allow the seamless integration of various business processes
in order to streamline the rollout of in-store promotions. I created several workflows that would extract data from 
message queues, perform various transformations and cleanup of the data and then load it into the company's promotions
system.
