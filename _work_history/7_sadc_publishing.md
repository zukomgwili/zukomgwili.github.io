### Description

My formal title was Web Designer but my responsibilities went far beyond building marketing websites. I built personal computers from component parts, worked on a project designing product promotion leaflets for the grand opening of a home improvement retailer (<a href="https://www.emartsa.co.za/" data-proofer-ignore>EMART</a>). I was also involved in building the computer network infrastructure for the aforementioned retailer.
