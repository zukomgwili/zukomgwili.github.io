### Description

My formal title was Web Designer but my responsibilities went far beyond building marketing websites. I built personal
computers from component parts, worked on a project designing product promotion leaflets for the grand
opening of a home improvement retailer ([EMART](https://www.emartsa.co.za/)). I was also involved in building the 
computer network infrastructure for the aforementioned retailer.
