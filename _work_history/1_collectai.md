### Description
I am an individual contributor in a team responsible for developing and supporting a payment portal that enables
customers to settle their invoices using several payment options. I contribute to a number of microservices that
support the payment portal. The two services that are worth highlighting are:
- A customer queries service which manages queries raised by customers and routes them to the relevant parties.
- A service that allows the customer to make alternative payment arrangements if he/she is unable to make payment.

I participate in discussions with design and the product teams about product goals and how best accomplish them.
