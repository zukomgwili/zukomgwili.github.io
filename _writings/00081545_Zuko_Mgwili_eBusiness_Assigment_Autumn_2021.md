Task 1

IBC Hamburg is a Christian church based in Hamburg, Germany. My choice of organization for an eBusiness case study maybe a bit unorthodox but I hope to demonstrate that IBC and many similar organization were able to adapt to the ever changing and evolving situation brought upon by the COVID-19 pandemic.
