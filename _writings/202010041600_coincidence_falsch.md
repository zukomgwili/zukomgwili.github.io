This has happened too many a times for it to be a concidence. 
I know from the very first that God was at work. I would be working on a technical problem in my work, stuck for ages and not able to see the solution.
And I say something as simple as, "My Father in heaven, what am I missing here? What am I not seeing?" and few moments later I have the solution. 
This is God's hand at work I have no doubt about it. At the time of this writing I have just experienced
the same miraculous problem solving a few moments ago.
